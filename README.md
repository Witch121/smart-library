🔥📚 smart-library
=========
Smart-Library is a full-stack, AI-assisted digital library management system designed for real-world implementation in modern libraries.

It was built as my final project for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, and like most things I create, it comes with both technical ambition and a mild existential undertone.

This system has two distinct user modes:

👩‍🏫 Admin (Librarian) Panel – for managing the collection, users, and book circulation

📖 User Mode – for browsing, borrowing, and interacting with the library like a slightly less romantic version of Belle from Beauty and the Beast

---
🧠 TL;DR:
A TypeScript-based, Firebase-powered library system with Gemini AI integration because I don’t believe in doing things halfway—I believe in doing them haunted.
---
***
🧠 Tech Stack Highlights:
---
Firebase – handles backend logic, authentication, and database management with cloud flair

Firestore – real-time data updates so the library stays alive and twitching

Gemini AI – integrated for smart querying, recommendation features, and just a touch of ✨algorithmic sorcery✨

TypeScript – because I enjoy strong typing and long walks on semantic beaches

React – for a clean, responsive UI that respects both users and their inner goth

***
💡 Features:
---
🔐 Secure Login/Auth System using Firebase

📚 Book Management with CRUD operations (admin only)

🧍‍♂️ User Portal for browsing, reserving, and borrowing books

🤖 AI Assistance via Gemini for recommendations, info, and possibly unsolicited emotional support

🔍 Search & Filter – functional enough to find that book you forgot the title of, but remember had a “blue cover and probably a vampire”

📈 Admin Dashboard with usage metrics and totalitarian control energy

🛠️ Real-time sync – every change reflects across the system immediately (because lag is for cowards)

🎓 Academic Purpose:
---
Developed as the capstone project for my Bachelor of Computer Engineering. The goal was to create a scalable, intuitive, and intelligent system that could modernize library experiences for both administrators and readers.

If you're evaluating this: yes, I built the full stack. Yes, it works. And yes, it nearly took my soul with it.

🔮 Coming Soon (aka “features I will finish during my next existential spiral”):
AI-powered recommendation engine with emotional intelligence (Gemini can probably tell when you're lying about reading Proust)

Natural language query (“show me sad books with redemption arcs and probably a dog”)

Reading progress tracking and existential dread meter
